            I enjoy designing elegant and robust software that solves complex issues because I am passionate about the art of coding. I've already worked in a variety of businesses, and I've been working with software development since 2008. I can create software from the ground up, whether it be desktop, mobile, or web-based. I also like dealing with legacy apps in case your firm requires assistance in changing your application to the most recent technology.
